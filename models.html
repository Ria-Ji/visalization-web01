      <h4>T-test (Sentiment)</h4>
      <p>This analysis applies the t-test to assess whether regulatory events significantly affect media sentiment towards, typically using sentiment scores from U.S. articles and comparing pre-event and post-event sentiment.</p>
      <ul>
       
      </ul>
      <h4>ANOVA</h4>
      <p>This analysis uses one-way ANOVA to evaluate whether regulatory events significantly impact sentiment scores. ANOVA is typically used to test for significant differences between the means of three or more groups. In this context, we analyze sentiment scores of articles published before, during, and after regulatory events within 1-month, 2-month, and 3-month windows.</p>
      <ul>
       
      </ul>
      <h4>MANOVA</h4>
      <p>This analysis uses the MANOVA test to evaluate whether regulatory events significantly impact sentiment and emotion scores of articles related. The MANOVA test is typically applied to test the difference in means of multiple dependent variables across groups. In this context, we analyze sentiment and emotion scores before and after regulatory events within 1-month, 2-month, and 3-month windows.</p>

      <h4>Cross Correlation</h4>
      <p>This analysis does a cross-correlation to examine the relationship between media sentiment and regulatory events. It is usually implied to test the influence or lead-lag relationship between two time series. We apply it on the following data: daily media sentiment scores and daily regulatory events from the USA.</p>
      <ul>
     
      </ul>
      <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
      <p>This analysis aims to determine the relationship between high media attention and the occurrence of events. Logistic regression is applied to test this hypothesis using a dataset comprising sentiment scores and regulatory events data.</p>
      <ul>
        
      </ul>
      <h4>Cox Model</h4>
      <p>This analysis does survival analysis to test the timing of regulatory events and their relation to various factors. Two different models were evaluated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Model 1: Variables include Event Type and Support Type</li>
        <li>Model 2: Variables include Event Type, Support Type, average sentiment, average emotion, and average hype</li>
      </ul>
